[Nx](https://nx.dev/), a set of extensible dev tools for monorepos, allows for [third-party plugins](https://nx.dev/nx-community) to support new frameworks, tooling, and more.

[nxtend](https://github.com/nxtend-team/nxtend) is a collection of third-party plugins to extend the functionality of an Nx workspace.

Currently, Ionic React is the only plugin that has been released, with a Capacitor plugin in the works.
