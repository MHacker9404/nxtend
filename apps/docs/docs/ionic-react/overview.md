[Ionic React](https://ionicframework.com/docs/components) is a collection of high-quality components for developing cross-platform applications.

I have been a fan of both Ionic and Nx for a while now, so once both of these projects added React support, they seemed like a natural pair. However, when I attempted to convert an Nx React application, I quickly ran into issues. With the help of the community and the Nrwl team, we are now able to develop Ionic React applications in an Nx workspace.

The goal of @nxtend/ionic-react is to enabled developers to create and maintain cross-platform applications in an Nx monorepo. The ability to develop cross-platform applications from a single codebase along with a monorepo that enables easy and effective sharing can be a powerful combination.

Updates to @nxtend/ionic-react will include migrations that will update the dependencies included with this plugin, as well as any code migrations if possible.
